Linked lists allow for simple insertion and deletion with a worst-case runtime complexity of O(1). 
However, a problem with linked lists is that they are notorious for a search runtime complexity of at least O(n).
Skip lists are a generalization of sorted linked lists by randomization. Due to the nature of its randomized structure, we can improve search to O(logn). 
I implement methods of a skip list to demonstrate its unique behaviour.
